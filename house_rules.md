# House Rules

These rules are in use for Gatharam: The West Marches. As more rules are discovered or adapted, they will be updated here.

### **Critical hits**

When you roll a critical hit, any additional damage dice that would be rolled use their maximum value instead.

### **Rest Variant: Gritty Realism**

While outside of the town of Gatharam, a short rest takes 8 hours and long rests take 7 days.

### **Inspiration**

Characters can stack more than one inspiration at a time. Additionally, a player can choose to use an Inspiration after they find out their roll fails. Inspiration will be awarded for the following reasons:

- At the DMâ€™s discretion
- For writing and posting a session summary
- For updating the player maintained region map with new locations

### Identifying Magic Items

Use the identify spell

Make a DC whatever Arcana check after spending an hour to attune

Just use it, dingus

### Gathering Materials for a Healing Potion

The character must be proficient with the Herbalism kit. They make an Investigation/Perception check. The total of the check is the number of gp worth of raw materials they discove.
