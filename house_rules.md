# House Rules

These rules are in use for Gatharam: The West Marches. As more rules are discovered or adapted, they will be updated here.

### **Critical hits**
When you roll a critical hit, any additional damage dice that would be rolled use their maximum value instead.

### **Rest Variant: Gritty Realism**
While outside of the town of Gatharam, a short rest takes 8 hours and long rests take 7 days.

### **Inspiration**
Characters can stack more than one inspiration at a time. Additionally, a player can choose to use an Inspiration after they find out their roll fails. Inspiration will be awarded for the following reasons:  
- At the DMâ€™s discretion
- For writing and posting a session summary
- For updating the player maintained region map with new locations

### Character HP
At each level up, instead of rolling for hit points, characters gain the maximum number.

### Identifying Magic Items
Characters can identify a magic item by:
- Using the identify spell
- Making an Arcana check after spending an hour to attune to the item. The DC of the check is determined by the items rarity.
- Just use it, dingus

### Gathering Materials for a Healing Potion
The character must be proficient with the Herbalism kit. They make an Investigation/Perception check. The total of the check is the number of gp worth of raw materials they discover.
