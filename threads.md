# Plot Threads

These are the current open threads:

1. Go explore! Pick a direction and see what's out there.
2. The stream flowing from the Elvish Tower in the Gloomwood is toxic; there is a half-full cistern of glowing water in the cellar.
3. The cult of the Maiden of Wisdom is searching for The Roguekin, as part of their summoning ritual (presumably).
4. It's not clear what was causing the holes full of teeth and bugs by the standing stone, west of Himlonde.
5. ~~Gavrak (of Gavrak's Mysical Emporium) will pay a premium for any and all pearls brought to him.~~ Gavrak is no longer interested in pearls.
7. Chases the Wind heard a rumor about an ogre carrying a (huge) skull up a hillside.
8. The dungeon behind Muck's door had some of its rooms collapse, but there is still the Statue of the Warrior that remains unexplored.
9. A entrance to a tomb of black skulls was found on the way to the shrine of healing water (which also had additional chambers left unexplored).
10. The tomb of Esur the Red is somewhere out there. Legends tell of his heavy black iron ring which he wore braided into his beard. With this ring, he was said to have defeated hordes of undead, and the Lich King Kasdall.
11. Somewhere between R'Hini and Muck's door, there's a ring of illusionary candles. The center of the ring is made of sinking rock, dirt, and sand.
12. A volcano, deep in the Anvil Mountains recently erupted. It's all anyone in Gatharam is talking about.
13. The Lost Undercrypt of Ages, somewhere in the Western Gatharaz Plains, holds a vast wealth of historical knowledge. Though the price of admissions is high, and not always paid in gold.
