# **What is The West Marches?**

The West Marches is a style of game that focuses on exploration, survival, and adventure. There is no set party – any player can make and play a new character at any time. As long as the DM and 3 to 5 players are available, a game can happen.

This is a semi-sandbox style game. There will be rumors and threads that characters can follow to seek out adventure, but it is just as viable (although maybe not as efficient) to begin wandering in the wilderness and let the adventure come to you.

Players take on the responsibility of uncovering new adventures, recruiting other characters to join on the adventure, and then scheduling the session with the DM.

## **Truths of The West Marches**

The town of Gatharam is safe. The town guards stationed in Gatharam patrol the streets and walls, keeping it safe. Adventure happens in the wilderness beyond the safe walls of Gatharam.

The wilderness outside of town is dangerous and strange. The wilds attract questionable characters, strange monsters, and untold horrors.

The region is always changing. The characters play a small part in the world, and other forces are at play. A cleared dungeon may be occupied again when the next group of characters adventures forth.

## **Character Creation Guidelines**

For this setting, choose class, race, feats, and spell options from the Player’s Handbook, Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, and Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse. The Custom Origin option in TCoE is allowed. Other sources may be allowed on a case by case basis. Ask your DM!

All characters start at level 1, using the shared stat array (16, 15, 15, 13, 13, 12) or 44 point-buy, using the following point-buy table:
|Score|Cost|
|---|---|
|8 (or less)    |0|
|9 |1|
|10 |2|
|11 |3|
|12 |4|
|13 |5|
|14 |7|
|15 |9|
|16 |12|
|17 |15|
|18 |19|

Character advancement is based on experience points which will be awarded for slaying monsters, as well as completing exploration or survival based tasks. Exact values depend on character’s level, wilderness tier, and difficulty of the tasks performed. Additional rewards may be added later.

## **Your Character(s) in TWM**

Your character(s) feel a strong call in their bones to adventure. The boredom of a calm life doesn’t appeal to them – they are driven to leave behind the safety of civilization and explore the wilds to make their name.

You should know three things about your character before their first adventure:

1. What they were doing (and where they are from) prior to arriving in Gatharam
2. What key events caused them to leave their prior life behind
3. What they hope to gain from adventuring in the West Marches

## **Pause For a Minute**

During the game, at any time, a player or the DM can say “Pause for a minute” to stop the current conversation, break character, and address the situation. This can be used for anything from “I really don’t like this thing in the game” to “I don’t understand why we’re in this dungeon”. Use it freely to clarify the direction of the game and address any concerns.

## **Sensitive Content**

This setting will not include non-consensual sexual contact or harrassment, player-initiated torture, player-initiated racism, violence towards non-hostile animals, violence towards children, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia.

Please bring up any other content you do not wish to include in the game.
