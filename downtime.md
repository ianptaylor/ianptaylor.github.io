## Physical  training
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in training at the Gatharam Barracks. You gain a d4, which you can add to all Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the next adventure.

## Improve Gatharam
Cost: varies. Spend your Downtime Action building an improvement for Gatharam. Pay the cost to establish a new town feature, or level up an existing town feature.
