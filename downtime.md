# Downtime Activities

Living in Gatharam costs little compared to an adventurer's income. Any daily cost of living is defrayed in the odd jobs and relationships that adventurers maintain.

When a character returns to adventure, from an absence of any duration, they can perform one Downtime Action. This action can be spent in the following ways (more to be discovered):

## Hard work
Cost: 0 gp. Spend your Downtime Action doing a little extra work. Tell the other players what you were doing, and gain Character Level x Tier d8 gp.

## Physical training
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in training at the Gatharam Barracks. You gain a d4, which you can add to all Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the next adventure.

## Mental training
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in research at the Gatharam Library. You gain a d4, which you can add to all Inntelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability checks and saving throws for the next advennture.

## Service at the Temple of Banem
Cost: 0 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in worship or some other form of clerical service for Hilde Hildegaard. You gain a Potion of Healing in exchange for your service.

## Improve Gatharam
Cost: varies. Spend your Downtime Action building an improvement for Gatharam. Pay the cost to establish a new town feature, or level up an existing town feature.
