# Downtime Activities

Living in Gatharam costs little compared to an adventurer's income. Any daily cost of living is defrayed in the odd jobs and relationships that adventurers maintain.

When a character returns to adventure, from an absence of any duration, they can perform one Downtime Action. This action can be spent in the following ways (more to be discovered):

## Hard Work
Cost: 0 gp. Spend your Downtime Action doing a little extra work. Tell the other players what you were doing, and gain Character Level x Tier d8 gp.

## Physical Training
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in training at the Gatharam Barracks. You gain a d6, which you can add to all Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the next adventure.

## Mental Training
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in research at the Gatharam Library. You gain a d4, which you can add to all Inntelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability checks and saving throws for the next advennture.

## Service at the Temple of Banem
Cost: 0 gp. Spend your Downtime Action engaging in worship or some other form of clerical service for Hilde Hildegaard. You gain a Potion of Healing in exchange for your service.

## Research
Cost: 25 gp. Spend your Downtime Action doing some form of research -- at the library, asking around Gatharam, or investigating other leads. Tell everyone what you're searching for, and how you're doing it. Then roll the appropriate skill, as determined by the DM. On a roll of 8 or less, you can ask the DM 1 question, which they will answer truthfully. On a roll of 9 to 15, you can ask 2 questions. On a roll of 16+, 3 questions.

## Buy a Magic Item
Cost: Varies. Spend your Downtime Action brokering a deal with Gavrak to find one specific magic item you are looking for. Pay the cost of the item, plus the brokerage fee, and you can add the item to your inventory.

## Hire additional Help
Cost: 50 gp. Spend your Downtime Action carousing in the Aide's Guild. For the next adventure, you have a Hireling (level 1). Not much more than a schlepper, this Hireling grants you an additiona carrying capacity of 150 lbs.

## Improve Gatharam
Cost: varies. Spend your Downtime Action building an improvement for Gatharam. Pay the cost to establish a new town feature, or level up an existing town feature.
